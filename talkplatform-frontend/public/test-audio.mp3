# This is a placeholder for the test audio file
# In a real implementation, you would place a short MP3 file here
# for testing audio output devices in the Green Room component.
# 
# You can use any short audio clip (2-3 seconds) like a beep or tone.
# For now, you can download a test tone from:
# https://www.soundjay.com/misc/beep-07.wav
# 
# Convert to MP3 and place it as test-audio.mp3 in the public folder.
